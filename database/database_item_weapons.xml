&#xA;A nimble sword with holes and delicate engravings on the blade. The sword once made the sound of a flute when wielded by one with the requisite skill. The pitch and tone were determined by the swinging angle.
&#xA;This sword was buried when the Wanderer's Troupe disbanded. Unearthed years later, it has long since lost its ability to sing. Even so, it still makes for a lethal weapon.
&#xA;
&#xA;Among the members of the Wanderer's Troupe was a valiant sword-wielding dancer.
&#xA;After the Troupe's attempt to tear down the ruling class failed, she was enslaved as a gladiator.
&#xA;
&#xA;Though all her hope and all her companions were lost, still she fought bravely.
&#xA;Her sword sang with the radiance of the morn's light, and she was dubbed the [Dawnlight Swordswoman.]
&#xA;
&#xA;In his youth, the Dawn Knight Ragnvindr was in the retinue of a knight.
&#xA;He went with his master to watch a gladiator match, and was moved by the Dawnlight Swordswoman's splendid finale.
&#xA;He named himself the Dawn Knight in her honor, and knew in his heart what he must do next." />
